The goal of this project is to build my own ipod classic style mp3 player. UI is heavily based on ipod ver. 1.3 for the ipod classic 5th gen, with some nice quality of life updates and features from later classics. 

Base parts needed for this project:
  - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 (Any seller)
  - 240x320 SPI display (https://www.pishop.us/product/240-320-general-2inch-ips-lcd-display-module/ - I used this one)
  - Cirque TM040040 Trackpad (https://www.mouser.com/c/?marcom=118816186 - Be careful to buy the correct one, 40mm flat overlay)

Parts needed for advanced form:
  - DAC (Yet to decide)
  - Battery (Yet to decide on capacity)
  - Connector Port (USB-C)
  - Likely other parts I have not thought of yet

Development Stages:

Step 0: <-- Currently here
  - Functional UI
  - Get Pi Zero connected to screen and trackpad
